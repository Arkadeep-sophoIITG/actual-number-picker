# Android: How should the number picker actually look like

A horizontal number picker for Android

Summary (what I want it to do in the end)
-----------------------------------------
- Swipe left and right for next and previous number
- Click to manually enter your number
- Assign a "number changed" listener
- Make it fit in a small-height constraint box

[ This is a custom view, completely written from the ground up - means no support from the Android framework ]
